# Enhancing Early Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Detection through Big Data and Ensemble Few-Shot Learning
This repository presents the implementation of an ensemble framework based on Prototypical Networks (ProtoNet), a powerful method in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. 
 ## Used datasets:
 In the proposed framework, the Kaggle Alzheimer dataset and ADNI datasets are used for evaluation:
